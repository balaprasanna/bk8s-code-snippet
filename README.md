# kubernetes-snippets
Modified Code snippets of kubernetes for visual studio code.

There are snippets to quickly create `pods`, `services`, `deployments`,etc. As well, there are snippets to 
quickly add parts of the descriptor like `ports`, `cmd` and `volumes`  

For example, if you start typing `bk_` a suggestion will be shown (`deployment, deployment_simple`), if you expand the snippet you will get something like this:
